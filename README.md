# OG Lab

Open Graph Composer & Preview.

## Quick Start

```sh
pnpm install  # or npm install / yarn
pnpm dev      # Vite at http://localhost:5173 and server at http://localhost:8787
```

Open the app, tweak fields, view previews, copy outputs.

For serverless deploy, replace Express with a Worker that exposes the same `/api/scrape` JSON.
